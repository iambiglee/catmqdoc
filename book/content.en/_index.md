# Introduction CatMQ
CatMQ is a typical message queue middleware developed based on the Kafka message architecture. It uses asynchronous communication and a publish-subscribe model message transmission queue.
For specific explanations of communication methods and transmission models, see the introduction to communication methods and message transmission models below.
CatMQ has the advantages of asynchronous communication, simple system topology, and low coupling between systems. It is mainly used in asynchronous decoupling and traffic peak-cutting and valley-filling scenarios.



The functional features of CatMQ are:
1. Sequential messages
2. Dynamic scaling of producers and consumers
3. Dynamic balance of consumers and message queues
4. Support one queue being subscribed by multiple consumer groups
5. Manually adjust consumption progress
6. Message persistence and regular cleanup
7. Retention and resending of failed messages
8. Management backend web page, capable of self-service operation and maintenance management
