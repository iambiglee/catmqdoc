# Introduction to CatMQ
CatMQ is a typical message queue middleware developed based on the Kafka messaging architecture. It utilizes asynchronous communication and a publish-subscribe model for message transmission queues. The specifics of the communication method and transmission model are detailed in the following sections.

CatMQ boasts the advantages of asynchronous communication, a simple system topology, and low coupling between systems. It is primarily used in scenarios requiring asynchronous decoupling and smoothing of traffic peaks and valleys.

Key features of CatMQ include:
1. Sequential Messaging
2. Dynamic scaling of producers and consumers
3. Dynamic balance between consumers and message queues
4. Support for a queue being subscribed to by multiple consumer groups
5. Manual adjustment of consumption progress
6. Message persistence and periodic cleaning
7. Retention and retransmission of failed messages
8. Web-based management console for self-service operation and maintenance
